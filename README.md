# GoPrompter

This project is my solution to having a better teleprompter application. Your pc becomes the controller and you can put the prompt anywhere you'd like, on your phone, another monitor, ... 

## How use GoPrompter?

You have a view application and a controller application. Have the view on your phone or extra monitor, open the application and that is it. It will display the ip and port to connect to the view. Next up open the controller application, configure your settings and shortcuts, add your script to the script box and that's it. The script box works with BBCode and is also displayed using BBCode.
